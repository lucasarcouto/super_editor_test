# super_editor_test
In this project I'm compiling a list of issues I had while testing super_editor. On each main.dart, there's a comment stating what the issue is, expected behavior, on which platforms they happen and steps to reproduce.

To run each of them, you can choose the run configuration named with it's associated issue.
